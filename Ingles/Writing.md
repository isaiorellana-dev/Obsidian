## daily notes
### October
#### Sunday October-25-2022
This is my first note to improve my writing skills in english, today is sunday, at the hour that im writing this day has been so boring, as boring as last sunday.
But yesterday unexpectedly was a good day, the electricity went out very early, usually when the electricity goes out i have nothing to do in the rest of the day, 'cause all the things i do needs electricity and internet.
I'm always in my computer sometimes studiying or coding in some project. I'm taking courses to be a web developer, today i have taken courses of `HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NPM, Webpack, React JS, Redux and Jest`, im being prepared to find my first work in tech. 

Well, i was writing about why yesterday was a good day even when the electricity gos out. Ok, luckily i knew that the electricity was going to go out yesterday, so i get prepared, i told my friend Suyapa if she wants to go to the parquecito with our pets; in the morning i played the ukulele, wash my shoes, i gave my dog a bath and at the nigth shave my legs, although i regret that . btw, the electricity went at the 11:00 AM, but i did'nt notice because i was bussy doing all the things that i said before.

Hello, today was a good day.
In the morning after *taking a shower* and eat a sandwich with coffee i went to the corner to buy some green bananas and then i went to the tortilleria. When i was in my house i continue with my `Regex`  course in platzi, but about  11:00AM came some of my family at my house, so *i went* to say hi and then i was talking with my cousin Lily about her career and my interest in being a developer.

A few minutes after we ate rice and ground beef with tajadas, for then i get ready to go to the gym. At the gym i say hi to my friend ==Carolina== and gave to her a gatorade, cause the oldest mans of the gym sometimes give gatorades to her, just because, yeah, we dont know why, its kinda weird but i want to think that they are just being nice, i hope so.
Well, i did my rutine,  talk with some friends, did hip thrust as ever and then i went to my house very hungry, cooked chili with eggs, were very tasty, ive got to do it again some day, and thats it. that was my day, see u tomorrow mamagueve.
